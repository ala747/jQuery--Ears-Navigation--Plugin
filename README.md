# jQuery Ears Navigations Plugin

jQuery Ears Navigations is a quick and dirty plugin which can transform your Previous/Next boring links on two fancy "ears" fixed positioned on both left and right sides of your browser window.

## Supported Browsers

- Firefox 3.5+
- Safari 4 and 5+
- Google Chrome 4+

IE 7+ partially works at this time (with some positioning problems; although it's not a high priority issue for me right now, I hope to have it fixed soon)

## Demos and Documentations

- TODO (sorry)
